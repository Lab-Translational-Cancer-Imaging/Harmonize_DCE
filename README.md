# Harmonization of T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI

Code to harmonize postcontrast images in T1-weighted dynamic contrast-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (DCE-MRI). This method was used to harmonize the contralateral parenchymal enhancement (CPE) of the healthy breast between two patient cohorts in the publication:

>van der Velden, BHM, et al. "Harmonization of Quantitative Parenchymal Enhancement in T1‐Weighted Breast MRI." Journal of Magnetic Resonance Imaging 52.5 (2020): 1374-1382 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/jmri.27244

CPE is described in the publication:
>van der Velden, Bas HM, et al. "Association between parenchymal enhancement of the contralateral breast in dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging and outcome of patients with unilateral invasive breast cancer." Radiology 276.3 (2015): 675-685. https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.15142192

And the effect of the cutoffs on CPE in the publication:

## Usage

An example python file is provided with all the necessary code to 1) harmonize postcontrast images and 2) calculate CPE before and after harmonization.

## Data
